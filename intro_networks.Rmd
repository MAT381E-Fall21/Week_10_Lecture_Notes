# Networks
- **Network analysis** is a suite of tools/methods developed to understand and analyze graphs in which several **vertices** (nodes) are connected each other through  **edges**.
- With an example from Facebook network, we can consider **vertices** are **users** in the network and **edges** are links denoting **friendships**.


```{r echo=FALSE, out.height='40%', out.width='40%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/fb.jpeg')  
```

#### Networks are everywhere!..

- In real life, network analysis helps us to understand complex relationships,
learn about behaviors, preferences, and trends.

#### Example continu'ed
- "Economists, policymakers, city planners, and companies have a strong interest in determining what factors contribute to healthy job markets, including what factors can help promote faster recovery after a shock, such as a major recession or the current Covid-19 pandemic." 
- "Traditional modeling approaches in this realm have treated **workers as narrowly linked to specific jobs**. 
- "In the real world, however, **jobs and sectors are linked**. <span style="color:red">Displaced workers can often transition to another job or sector requiring similar skills.</span>"
- "In this way, **job markets are much like ecosystems, where organisms are linked in a complex web of relationships**.
- "The authors modeled the relationships between jobs in cities across the United States. They predicted that **cities with jobs connected by overlapping skills** and geography would fare better in the face of economic shock than those without such networks."
- "They found that while cities of similar sizes would be affected similarly in the beginning phases of automation shocks, those with **well-connected job networks** would provide **better opportunities** for displaced workers to find other jobs." 
- "This provides a buffer against widespread unemployment, and in some cases even leads to **more jobs** being created in the aftermath of the initial automation shock."
- A city like Burlington, Vermont, where job connectivity is high, would fare much better than Bloomington, Indiana, a similar-sized city where job connectivity is low.
- "The findings of the study suggest that **policymakers should consider job connectivity** when planning for the future of work in their regions, especially where automation is expected to replace large numbers of jobs." 
- "Furthermore, in individual occupations, workers in jobs that are more “embedded” (connected to other jobs) in a region **earn higher wages** than similar workers in areas where those jobs are not as connected."

#### Example: Open Syllabus Co-assignment Galaxy
- An interactive visualization of the underlying “co-assignment graph” – the network of relationships among books and articles formed by aggregating over all pairs of titles that appear together in the same courses.

#### Popular Network Analysis Software
- Network analysis and visualization tools are mostly implemented either in a **specific software with a GUI** such as:
   - [Gephi](https://gephi.org/) and
   - [Cytoscape](https://cytoscape.org/)
- or in a **package/library within a programming language** such as:
   - [igraph](https://igraph.org/) (R/Python library),
   - [tidygraph](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidygraph/index.html) (R library),
   - [ggraph](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggraph/index.html) (R library), and
   - [NetworkX](https://networkx.org/) (Python library).
---
#### Graph Data Bases
- There also graph databases such as [Neo4j graph data base](https://neo4j.com/) which stores the relationship between data records in a graph format and allows users to do queries with complex connections.
